# Impact of Extracurricular Activities on Career Goals

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning pipeline to study the impact of involvement in extracurricular activities on career goals. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and dimensionality reduction, followed by a classification task using a Random Forest classifier.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling inconsistent data, and managing missing values.
- **Data Visualization:** Box plots, histograms, and scatter plots for outlier detection and distribution analysis.
- **Data Transformation:** Outlier removal and Z-score normalization.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmap visualization of feature correlations.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implementation of PCA and LDA to reduce feature space.
- **Classification:** Random Forest classifier for predicting career goals based on extracurricular involvement with accuracy evaluation.
